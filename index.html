            Sephardi is one of the predominant Jewish sub-ethnicities. Sephardic Jews are
            originally from regions that form modern day Spain and Portugal, but were expelled
            during the Spanish Inquisition, often to areas with no other Jewish communities
            such as West Asia and North Africa. Today, Sephardic Jews also refers to Jewish
            communities from these parts of the world. Sephardic Jews have their own
            rabbinical council which has resulted in slightly different laws and variations of
            Jewish traditions. Sephardic Jews established some of the first Jewish communities
            in the United States, dating back to pre-colonial times. There was no mass
            immigration of Sephardic Jews, like those from Eastern Europe. Rather they trickled
            in. Today, the United States has the third largest Sephardic Jewish community in the
            world. <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/ashkseph.htm" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

            from consistent anti-Semitism and oppression, Ashkenazi Jews played a significant
            role in the development of European culture and science. Ashkenazi Jews created
            the Yiddish language, a mix of German and Hebrew, from which many words have
            become commonplace, not just amongst Jews, but in colloquial English (i.e.
            schmuck). Huge influxes of Ashkenazi Jews came to America at various points, the
            most influential of which were the immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century.

            Judaism is split into four main religious movements – Orthodox, Conservative,
            Reconstructionist and Reform (the survey used as a basis for this project grouped
            the reconstructionist and reform movements together). The movements differ
            primarily on levels of observance and the interpretations of religious scripture and
            Jewish laws. Each denomination is further divided into different sects. Within the
            orthodox movement, there are many different sects all with very specific
            interpretations and complexities associated with each particular one. For instance,
            observant Jews, specifically orthodox, employ a dress code, keep kosher and
            observe Shabbat – but these might take different forms depending on the sect.

            A synagogue is the Jewish house of assembly used for prayer, study of the Torah and
            for community gatherings. A synagogue is not imperative for prayer. Jewish law
            dictates that a minyan, ten men, need to be present, anywhere, in order to conduct
            group prayers. Though most praying can be done individually, a minyan is required
            to read the Torah and for certain holidays. The minimal traditional expectations of a
            synagogue include: a bimah (a platform from which the Torah is read and a rabbi
            conducts prayer) and an arc containing the Torah. Traditionally, both the bimah and
            the arc are situated so that the congregation faces east, towards Israel, during
            prayer. Whether Jerusalem is actually east is a point of argument.

            Keeping kosher refers to following the Jewish dietary requirements as outlined by
            the Torah and accompanying rabbinical law. Kashrut only allows certain animals to
            be consumed (the most well-known items include pork and shellfish) and killed in a
            specific way. It is also forbidden to mix dairy with meat. Fish, eggs and all other food
            items are considered ‘pareve’, meaning neither dairy or meat. Kosher kitchens have
            separate dishes and cooking utensils for dairy and meat. If possible, separate sinks
            and counters are used or even two kitchens. In more modern times, the definition of
            kosher has extended to rabbi supervision for the preparation of processed or
            packaged foods, and regular inspections of any kosher establishments. The degree
            of strictness varies between sub-ethnicities, denominations and individual

            and mysticism. Hassidic Jews have since branched out into multiple sects that

            Halakhic Law refers to both God-mandated law as well as rabbinical law. As with
            most religious scripture, there are various interpretations of the material. While
            some is universal across Judaism, the technicalities of others were (and continue to
            be) argued amongst Jewish leaders. Some is between sects and others between
            ethnic group of Jews. For instance, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews differ on which
            non-grains (i.e. rice, beans, non-grain seeds) are allowed during Passover. More
            sect-specific examples include whether women can wear trousers or whether using

            Passover is a holiday that celebrates the Jewish people�s escape from slavery in
            Egypt. It tells the story of how Moses became a leader, freed the Jews and helped

            eight days everywhere else (in the past, there was difficulty determining Israeli time

            story when Jews were forced to run carrying unleavened dough on their shoulders
